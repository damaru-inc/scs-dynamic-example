# SCS Dyanamic Example

This shows how there is a resource leak with Spring Integration Channels when you 
send each message to a dynamic topic.

Right now it's configured to be used with Rabbit, but you can switch to Solace
by switching to the sol-pom.xml file.

You can watch the leak happen using Prometheus and Grafana.
